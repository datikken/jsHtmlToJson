<p>Industry figures are divided on a contentious Californian artificial intelligence bill that passed on Aug.</p>
<p>The new legislation will compel AI firms to implement new safety protocols, including an “emergency stop” button for
    AI models.</p>
<p>The Safe and Secure Innovation for Frontier Artificial Intelligence Models Act (SB 1047) passed the California Senate
    29–9 on Aug. 28.</p>
<p>The bill now goes to Governor Gavin Newson’s desk for ratification.</p>
<p>Elon Musk was among those who expressed support for the bill. On X, he said it was a “tough call” but favored the
    legislation due to the “potential risk” of AI.

<p>Not all tech figures are similarly persuaded, however. OpenAI chief strategy officer Jason Kwon is among those who
    have criticized the legislation.</p>
<p>Calanthia Mei, co-founder of the decentralized AI network Masa, said she was not in favor of the new rules,
    suggesting they were the result of an undue rush to legislate.</p>
<p>“Premature regulations like this will not only drive talent out of California; it will drive talent out of America,”
    Mei told Cointelegraph. She added:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The risk sits in the likely possibility that America’s current and proposed regulatory frameworks cap
    the growth of the AI industry.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Raheel Govindji, the CEO of the decentralized AI project DecideAI, took a contrasting view.</p>
<p>“We are in favor of legislation,” Govindji told Cointelegraph. </p>
<p>Govindji said DecideAI supports a killswitch controlled by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), which is
    how they propose to democratize and decentralize an emergency stop.</p>
<h2>AI is a fast-moving industry</h2>
<p>The fast-moving nature of the AI industry has stoked fears about its unfettered development.</p>
<p>In an Aug. 22 letter, former staff and whistleblowers at OpenAI <a data-ct-non-breakable="null"
                                                                      href="https://static.politico.com/ed/a3/b49946554f5ead081a5df2063048/letter-from-openai-whistleblowers-on-sb-1047-2024-08-22-2.pdf"
                                                                      rel="null" target="null" text="null">warned</a>,
    “Developing frontier AI models without adequate safety precautions poses foreseeable risks of catastrophic harm to
    the public.”</p>
<p>But to others, the rapid pace of AI development is something to be celebrated rather than feared.</p>
<p><em><strong>Recent: </strong></em><a data-ct-non-breakable="null"
                                        href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-layer2-defi-blockchain-adoption"
                                        rel="null" target="null" text="null"><em><strong>Solutions without problems: How
    many Ethereum layer 2s are too many?</strong></em></a></p>
<p>“In contrast to other transformative technologies, the speed of AI innovation is unparalleled. Builders are shipping
    new products, features and applications every day,” Mei said.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We as builders don’t even know where the ceiling of AI is; how would the government know the ceiling of
    AI? Setting limits for high-potential technologies is unwise.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Mei warned that the legislation’s ultimate cost would be to “drive talent out of the US” as it “did to crypto.”</p>
<h2>Those in favor</h2>
<p>Govindji proposes that a “DAO-controlled killswitch” could support the requirements of the legislation while still
    retaining “collective and transparent decision-making.”</p>
<p>The bill states that any AI model should be able to “promptly enact a full shutdown” but fails to define the meaning
    of promptly, leaving considerable room for interpretation.</p>
<p>For now, it is unknown whether a DAO model and its democratic voting system would be prompt enough to satisfy
    legislators. Govindji is confident it will. According to Govindji, DecideAI “will be ahead of the curve in providing
    AI which is a social good.”</p>
<p>AI firm Anthropic has also publicly supported the bill. </p>
<p>In an open letter to Governor Newsom, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said, ”AI systems are advancing in capabilities
    extremely quickly, which offers both great promise for California’s economy and substantial risk [...] We believe SB
    1047, particularly after recent amendments, likely presents a feasible compliance burden for companies like ours, in
    light of the importance of averting catastrophic misuse.”</p>
<p>An earlier version of the bill forwarded criminal penalties for companies that failed to comply. After consultation
    with the industry, this provision was watered down to civil penalties only.</p>
<h2>Bill SB 1047</h2>
<p>Bill SB 1047 will only apply to “covered models,” with the definition of what models are covered shifting over
    time. </p>
<p>On implementation, a covered model will be an AI that costs over $100 million to develop or “An artificial
    intelligence model trained using a quantity of computing power greater than 10^26 integer or floating-point
    operation.”</p>
<p>The federal government’s Government Operations Agency will adjudicate any changes to the computing power
    threshold.</p>

<p>In a letter to Governor Newsom, OpenAI’s Kwon argued that legislation toward AI should only be handled at a federal
    level “rather than a patchwork of state laws.”</p>
<p>Given the overwhelming concentration of tech and AI firms in California, SB 1047 might arguably be the de facto
    national legislation for now. </p>
<p>The situation could change should the legislation cause AI firms to flee to other states, but to avoid SB 1047
    entirely, the firms would also need to cease all operations and services in California.</p>
